# 3D-Solar-System-Using-Javascript
🪐 Overview

This project is a 3D interactive Solar System simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery). It visually represents the planets orbiting around the sun, showcasing a realistic space environment with dynamic animations, rotation effects, and smooth transitions between 2D and 3D views.

The project is designed to help users understand the structure and motion of our Solar System in a visually engaging way.

🚀 Features

🌞 Realistic 3D view of the Solar System

🌍 Animated planetary orbits and rotations

🌠 Interactive controls for zooming, speed, and viewing angles

🧭 Toggle between 2D and 3D modes

⚙️ Responsive interface with control and data panels

💡 Built entirely using front-end technologies (no external 3D engines)

🧰 Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure and layout

CSS3 – Animations and 3D transformations

JavaScript (jQuery) – Dynamic behavior and user interaction

🎮 How to Use

Open the project folder and launch the index.html file in your browser.

Use the control buttons to switch between 2D/3D views, zoom in/out, or adjust speed.
